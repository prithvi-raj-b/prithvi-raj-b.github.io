    description="I’m passionate about building intelligent robotic systems that bridge the gap between autonomy and human needs. I have experience working on AMRs, manipulators and the perception systems that allow them to sense the world around them. What excites me most is enabling robots to see, reason, and act, whether it’s mapping unknown environments, detecting obstacles, or grasping an object. Currently I'm pursuing my Master's in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Scroll down to see my work!"
