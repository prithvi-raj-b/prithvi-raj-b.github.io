### Team Member & Control Systems Lead

Team Anveshak was where my passion for robotics was ignited. Being part of the Electronics & Software Subsystem of the team, I learnt ROS and how to program robotic systems using it. I also learnt about the electronics that are essential towards the functioning of the Mars Rover. 

During my time in the team, I worked on implementing the RTabMapping algorithm for mapping the environment and PID control for balancing the manipulator during teleoperation. Our final rover, named Foresight, competed in Anatolian Rover Challenge in Turkey 2022, a competition with participants from 20+ teams around the world. We achieved 6th place in the competition.
