### Project Assistantship - guided by Prof. Bijo Sebastian

Initially, I was working with CNN based approaches along with a Master's student for his thesis. During this period, I learnt about grasp planning metrics, methods and tools available like GraspIt! Simulator and different grasp planning representations for different types of grippers. 

After this initial period, I set to work on my own version of the pipeline, using RANSAC algorithm to identify primitive shapes in the environment like cylinders, spheres, cuboids and thin plates. Combined an image segmentation and classification model with an LLM for visual and semantic knowledge. The resultant system was capable of identifying common household objects in the workspace, determine its primitive shape and instruct the manipulator to pick up the object accordingly.
